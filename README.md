- Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, tell us who and in what capacity.
  - *edit me (add more rows if needed)*

- Did you use any external resources? (Cite them below)

## Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.northeastern.edu` to complete and test your work. 

## Important notes

* Your code **must compile and run** on the Khoury machines to earn credit. Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we grade your assignments.
* You must commit any additional files (if any) into your repository so we can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!
* Do not forget, once you have pushed your changes to your repo make sure that you **submit them to Gradescope before the assignment deadline!**

## Discussion questions to answer


1. Explain what you think the worst-case big O complexity and the best-case big O complexity of bubble sort is as implemented in our code. Give reasons for why you think that is the big O complexity for each case.

2. 2. Is there a more efficient way to write bubble sort that changes the performance in the best case? If so, describe (in general terms, we don't need the exact C code) how that implementation of bubble sort would be different.
 
3. Explain what you think the worst-case big O complexity and the best-case big O complexity of selection sort is as you've implemented it. Why do you think that
?

4. Does selection sort require any additional storage (i.e. did you have to allocate any extra memory to perform the sort?) beyond the original array?

5. Explain what you think big O complexity of sorting algorithm that is built into the C libraries is. Why do you think that? Do a little bit of research to try to answer this one - it's a preview of the faster sorts we'll see soon.
